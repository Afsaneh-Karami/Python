# Writing Ping Pong Game in python with turtle library:
In this code I used turtle library to creat screen, rockets, ball, and a board to show the result of play.

### introduction of Turtle library:
turtle is a Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. In computer graphics, turtle graphics are vector graphics using a relative cursor upon a Cartesian plane. Turtle graphics is a key feature of the Logo programming language.
