# Google geocoding web service
Google has an excellent web service that allows us to make use of their large database of geographic information. We can submit a geographical search string like “Ann Arbor, MI” to their geocoding API and have Google return its best guess as to where on a map we might find our search string and tell us about the landmarks nearby.</br>
This program is a simple application to prompt the user for a search string, call the Google geocoding API, and extract information from the returned JSON.
